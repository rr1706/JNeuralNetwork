Save network architecture and weights to file, perhaps txt
Load a network from same type of file
Train turret (one motor) to line up with vision data in t seconds (ex .25)
  Randomly assign h and t
  Pass them into network as inputs
  Train based off difference in heading
  Repeat until perfect
Train robot (2 motors) to line up with vision data in t seconds (ex .25)
  Randomly assign h and t
  Pass them into network as inputs
  Train based off difference in heading (and penalize for moving the robot a lot)
  Repeat until perfect
Train swerve (8 motors) to go to (x, y, h) in t seconds
  Randomly assign an x, y, h, and t
  Pass them in as inputs to the NN
  Train based off difference in positiion and heading
  Repeat until perfect
