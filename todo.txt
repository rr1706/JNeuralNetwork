1. Set it up fo package.1706.whatever
2. Save network architecture and weights to file, perhaps txt
3. Load a network from same type of file
4. Use PID to line up turret with vision data (one motor)
5. Use PID to line up a robot with vision data(8 motors)
6. Train turret (one motor) to line up with vision data in t seconds (ex .25)
  -Randomly assign h and t
  -Pass them into network as inputs
  -Train based off difference in heading
  -Repeat until perfect
7. Train swerve (8 motors) to go to (x, y, h) in t seconds
  -Randomly assign an x, y, h, and t
  -Pass them in as inputs to the NN
  -Train based off difference in positiion and heading
  -Repeat until perfect
